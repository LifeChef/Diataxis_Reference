## Using Explanations

Explanation documents help you:
- Understand the "why" behind decisions
- Learn concepts and principles
- See trade-offs and alternatives
- Connect theory to practice

These docs provide:
- Background and context
- Reasoning and rationale
- Comparisons with alternatives
- Real-world implications
- Related concepts

## Not Step-by-Step

Explanations don't provide:
- Installation instructions → See [Tutorials](../tutorials/)
- Specific task solutions → See [How-To Guides](../how-to/)
- API specifications → See [Reference](../reference/)

Instead, they deepen understanding of the system's design and principles.

## Target Audience

- New team members learning the system
- Architects evaluating our approach
- Developers making similar decisions
- Technical leadership understanding trade-offs
